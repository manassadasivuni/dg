title: The Extrovert Ideal

In recent times, we have grown less tolerant of those who are closer to the introverted side of the spectrum. We are told that to be successful is to be bold, to put yourself out there, to socialise like there's no tomorrow. Yet, half the world are introverts. Some people may pretend to be extroverts, or even do not believe they are until an event forces them to discover their true selves. 

The reason introverts are "hidden" is due to the value system we have in place (labelled the _Extrovert Ideal_ by Susan Cain, author of _Quiet_). The Extrovert Ideal states that the best version of yourself is loud, dominant, comfortable in the limelight. This typical extrovert prefers to take action rather than think, to take risks rather than hedge bets. They favour fast decisions, even when they are the wrong choice. This Ideal makes us think that we value all kinds of individuals when in reality we only appreciate a single type of individual: the one who "puts themselves out there". 

This has been documented in various studies, but hasn't been given a common label. Some studies show that talkative people are believed to be smarter, good-looking and more interesting. The same goes for fast talkers. 

While extroversion can be an appealing lifestyle, the focus on it has created an oppressive culture where introverts (who are sensitive, serious, and shy) are seen as a liability. The "exception" to this rule are the introverts who create tech empires from their garage. 

Since we live in this Ideal, it makes sense that the systems we create reflect it. This can be seen in the way that classrooms are organised into "pods" where children can socialise while learning; the way our media salivates over outsized personalities and the drama they cause. The Extrovert Ideal is visible in the way we work: open-plan offices, team projects, employers who value social skills. In fact, not being an extrovert is likely to damage your career as it's expected that you must promote yourself relentlessly to even have the slightest chance at a promotion. 

Of course, such an Ideal will have significant consequences, and also raises questions.
